    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages of using API:-\n",
    "# (1) When applications rely on external APIs, they become dependent on the availability and reliability of those services. \n",
    "# If the external API experiences downtime or undergoes changes, it can impact the functionality of dependent applications.\n",
    "# (2) Sharing data through APIs raises concerns about data privacy and security. \n",

    "# A Web API, or Web Application Programming Interface, is an interface that allows different software applications to communicate\n",
